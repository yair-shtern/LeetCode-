# A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
#
# Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
# If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
#
# You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words,
# an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
#
# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
